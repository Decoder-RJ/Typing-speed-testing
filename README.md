# Typing Speed Tester
A web-based application to test typing speed and accuracy. This application allows users to practice their typing skills by providing a random paragraph and measuring the user's words per minute (WPM) and error count as they type. It also highlights correct and incorrect words in real-time, making it an interactive and educational tool for improving typing skills.

<h2>Features</h2>
Real-Time Typing Speed Measurement: Displays the words per minute (WPM) as the user types.
Error Tracking: Counts typing errors and displays them, with incorrect words highlighted in red and correct words in green.
Randomized Texts: Provides random text samples to type, ensuring a fresh challenge each time.
Timer: A countdown timer set to 60 seconds, which can be reset as needed.
Auto-Submit on Completion: Automatically submits the test when the user types the entire text correctly.
Reset Functionality: Resets the timer, text, WPM, and error count to restart the typing test.
<h2>How It Works</h2>

Typing and Feedback: As the user types, the application:
Tracks WPM by dividing the number of correctly typed words by the elapsed time.
Highlights correct words in green and incorrect words in red.
Updates the error count as incorrect words are typed.
End Test: The test ends either when the time runs out or when the user completes the text accurately. The final WPM and error count are displayed.
